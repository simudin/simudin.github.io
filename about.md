Hi! I'm Hasim Sofaruddin, a web developer from [Sumedang](https://www.google.co.id/maps/place/Sumedang+Regency,+West+Java/@-6.8101905,107.9804,11z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x2e68d44077fd6029:0x301e8f1fc28b920?hl=en), Indonesia. Currently, I work at [Quipper](http://video.quipper.com), as a Web Developer. I write about programming and other technical stuff in this blog. You can also know me by the way I [tweet](http://twitter.com/simudin), my [interest](https://www.pinterest.com/hasimsofaruddin), my not-so-private [social book](http://facebook.com/hasim.sofaruddin) and from my [resume]({{ site.baseurl}}/assets/HasimSofaruddinResume.pdf). A self-proclaimed-nerd, I loves comic books and superheroes. Currently, I live in Jakarta. But still, Sumedang is the city where my heart belongs to.
